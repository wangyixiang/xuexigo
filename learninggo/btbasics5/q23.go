/*
Q23. (2) Method calls

1. Suppose we have the following program. Note the package contain-
er/vector was once part of Go, but has been removed when the append
built-in was introduced. However, for this question this isnâ€™t impor-
tant. The package implemented a stack-like structure, with push and
pop methods.
package main
import "container/vector"func main() {
k1 := vector.IntVector{}
k2 := &vector.IntVector{}
k3 := new(vector.IntVector)
k1.Push(2)
k2.Push(3)
k3.Push(4)
}
What are the types of k1, k2 and k3?

2. Now, this program compiles and runs OK. All the Push operations work
even though the variables are of a different type. The documentation
for Push says:
func (p *IntVector) Push(x int) Push appends x to the end of
the vector.
So the receiver has to be of type *IntVector, why does the code above
(the Push statements) work correct then?
