/*
Q27. (1) Channels
1. Modify the program you created in exercise Q2 to use channels, in other
words, the function called in the body should now be a goroutine and
communication should happen via channels. You should not worry
yourself on how the goroutine terminates.
2. There are a few annoying issues left if you resolve question 1. One
of the problems is that the goroutine isnâ€™t neatly cleaned up when
main.main() exits. And worse, due to a race condition between the
exit of main.main() and main.shower() not all numbers are printed. It
should print up until 9, but sometimes it prints only to 8. Adding a sec-
ond quit-channel you can remedy both issues. Do this. a
